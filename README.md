## Introduction

Next.js recently became the official React framework as outlined in React docs.
In this project i'm trying to cover all the most important features and concepts.

# In this project, i'm covering the following topics:

- Use Next.js 13 App Router and Server Side Rendering
- Implement Advanced Search Functionality
- Create Filtering Capabilities
- Optimize Metadata and SEO
- Create custom filter, combobox, and modal elements
- Maintain a well-organized file and folder structure.
- Embrace the principles of writing clean code.

# Technology

- For sure it will be React.js function component.
- Typescript.
- TailwindCss
- Headless UI
- RapidApi

## Project keys:

- Fully structured Next.js application.
- Fully searching.
- Landing on TailwindCss & Headless UI and building amazing user interface.

## Getting Started

- First you need the follwing keys to be in your .env file:

1- Installing Headless ui.
2- Subscribe to RapidApi.
3- Vercel as our deployment server.

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
